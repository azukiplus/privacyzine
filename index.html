        <h2>So, privacy...? üí≠</h2>
        <p>
          In this day and age, it's difficult to say if we can ever be completely private: completely shut off from the
          world with no one able to reach us, contact us, or find any information about us. Partially, this may be due
          to how interconnected our lives are with technology. I am a firm believer that the internet is one of the
          greatest inventions of human history in this current age. But, this easy access to the internet has made much
          of our lives exposed to anyone who is looking for information about us. On this page, I want to focus on the
          concept of privacy on the internet, particularly data privacy.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Why is data privacy important?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Companies use our data in many ways. They can use it to improve their services, they can use it to figure out
          how to get us to spend more money, or they can sell our information to other companies, including other uses.
          What's the last search you made on your favorite search engine? Your information is constantly being tracked.
          However, you might wonder why it's important to be so conscious of data privacy when these companies aren't
          necessarily doing anything bad with our data. <span class="fst-italic">Sure, they could be selling our data,
            but is that really that bad? </span>you might wonder. Even if you don't think that what these companies are
          doing is bad, one of the biggest issues that I want to address is how this data can be passed onto malicious
          people or groups that can sabotage you as a user.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a few categories of common privacy threats:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Intentional uses of personal information in the public and private sector by governments or marketing</li>
          <li>Unauthorized uses by company insiders</li>
          <li>Theft of information</li>
          <li>Inadvertent information leaks through careless</li>
          <li>Our actions (can be intentional or unintentaional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
          Let's try an example.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Let's say you make an account on this site. (The following is a placeholder form and won't do anything even if
          you click submit.)
        </p>

        <div class="container mb-4">
          <form class="mt-4 bg-white p-4 rounded">
            <h4>Make an account on this totally trustworthy site!</h4>
            <div class="mb-3">
              <label for="exampleInputEmail1" class="form-label">Email address</label>
              <input type="email" class="form-control" id="exampleInputEmail1" aria-describedby="emailHelp">
              <div id="emailHelp" class="form-text">We'll definitely !!!! never share your email with anyone else.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-3">
              <label for="exampleInputPassword1" class="form-label">Password</label>
              <input type="password" class="form-control" id="exampleInputPassword1">
            </div>
            <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
          </form>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            So, what are some problems with the above form?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Am I (the author of this site) really trustworthy?</span> You don't know what I
              will do with your information. Reputable companies usually allow you to check a box agreeing to legal
              terms about their services while creating an account. These terms often spell out how your personal
              information will be used. Without checking such a box, you don't know what I will do with your data when
              you make an account. </li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Plaintext or hashed passwords?</span> You don't know how this site stores
              information. If it's a reputable site, most likely, it will completely cut out having to deal with the
              password entirely and will use a 3rd party company-- one built around storing personal information-- to
              handle all sensitive information. By doing so, even if an attacker is somehow able to hack into the site,
              it won't have any sensitive information stored. There have been cases of large tech companies like <a
                href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-passwords-plaintext-change-yours/"> Facebook storing
                passwords in plaintext</a>, compromising millions of people's passwords. The issue with storing
              passwords in plaintext is that anyone who gets access to those files will easily be able to see what
              users' passwords are without having to decrypt them. Similarly, if you're buying things off of the internet and you get asked to enter your credit card information, proceed with caution if they aren't using a 3rd party payment service. </li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Can you think of more problems?</span></li>
          </ul>

        </div>

        <h4>So, how do I stay safe online?</h4>
        <p>
          We store a lot of information online, whether that be intentionally or unintentionally. In order to keep ourselves safe, there are a few tips we can follow.

                <p>‚ÄúIf you put a key under the mat for the cops, a burglar can find it, too. Criminals are using every
                  technology tool at their disposal to hack into people's accounts. If they know there's a key hidden
                  somewhere, they won't stop until they find it.‚Äù</p>

          <ul>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Update your passwords and create strong passwords.</span> By using different passwords and constnatly updating them, even if one password gets breached, not all of your passwords would be compromised.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Use trustworthy sites.</span> Don't create accounts on scam sites or sites that aren't reputable. </li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">Protect yourself against common cyber-attacks and scams.</span> Keep yourself informed about common scams and attacks on the internet. For example, on the messaging app Discord, I once got a message from an old friend asking me to try a new game that they developed. They sent me a .exe file that was very suspicious, so I started to grill them about their personal life. It became apparently quickly that they were hacked. </li>
